        This function uses local search for finding the three best place of the fence.
        The system calls your algorithm multiple times, repeatedly.
        Each time, it provides new position of your pawn and asks your next decision
         until time limit is reached, or until you return a BLOCK action.

        Each time you have to decide one of the action.

        - If you decide to answer the best place, return BLOCK action
